* Encoding must be available via public Github repositories.
* Encoding must be made available under a public (e.g., a Creative Commons) license. 
* The licensing of the encoding must be explicitly stated in the GitHub repository and/or in the encoding itself, e.g. using the MEI [useRestrict](https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/elements/userestrict) element.
