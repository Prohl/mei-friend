abstract = {Close listening is a mainstay of the musicological study of performance recordings, but paying focused, critical attention carries high cognitive overhead, making the application of this approach difficult when dealing with large corpora. In Signature&nbsp;Sound&nbsp;Vienna, a project investigating the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra’s New Year’s Concert series by means of collected concert recordings and associated information, we have developed a Web-native digital musicology environment to help address this issue. We apply the Music Annotation Ontology, recently proposed in the literature, to capture linked data annotations on abstracted representations of music objects. For the first time, this approach is applied to information in both encoded score and recorded audio modalities, using an extended version of the mei-friend music encoding editor, and the Listen Here close-listening tool newly developed for this purpose. Together, this environment enables scholars to annotate digital music scores and immediately access the corresponding playback positions in collections of performance recordings. All tools are semantic Web applications, applying the Web-native Solid platform for social linked data for authentication and user-controlled data storage. The architecture integrates the different tools on the data level, permitting the future addition of further externally-developed tooling. Here, we motivate the developed environment within our research context, detail its implementation, and report on experiences applying the tooling within our music scholarship.},

    abstract = {Solid is a decentralized platform for social Web applications. In the Solid platform, users' data is managed independently of the applications that create and consume this data. Each user stores their data in a Web-accessible personal online datastore (or pod). Each user can have one or more pods from different pod providers, and can easily switch between providers. Applications access data in users' pods using well defined protocols, and a decentralized authentication and access control mechanism guarantees the privacy of the data. In this decentralized architecture, applications can operate on users' data wherever it is stored. Users control access to their data, and have the option to switch between applications at any time. We will demonstrate the utility of Solid and how it is experienced from the point of view of end users and application developers. For this, we will use a set of Solid servers and multiple Web applications that use these servers. We believe that experience with a concrete platform such as Solid is highly valuable in truly appreciating the power of a decentralized social Web.},
